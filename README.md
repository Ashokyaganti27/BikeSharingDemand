# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

ðŸ“Œ project Overview--

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline to  build a predictive model that accurately forecasts bike rental demand based on historical usage patterns, weather conditions, and time-related features.

âœ… Current Progress

## Data ingestion Pipeline completed

- Connected securely to Kaggle API for dataset access.
- Automated the data download and storage process using a Python script.
- Implemented  exception handling and logging for Tracing.
- Stored the raw dataset under a dedicated versioned path: artifacts/data/raw/.

## Data validation Pipeline completed

## **Key Checks Performed**

- Validated column names match the expected schema.

- Ensured column order is consistent with training schema.

- Verified data types of each column (e.g., int64, object, etc.).

- Checked both train and test datasets.

- Gives True if Success Otherwise False.

## Data Source

The dataset comes from Kaggle's **Bike Sharing Demand competition**. It contains historical usage patterns with weather data for a bike sharing system.
